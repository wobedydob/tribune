            I'm gonna tell you a story
            Strange as it might seem
            Of zombie voodoo gris-gris
            And the Witch Queen of New Orleans
            She lived in a world of magic
            Possessed by the devil's skew
            From her shack near the swampland
            Made of mud-pie brick
            Marie stirred her witch's brew
            Dime or a nickel, anyone could buy
            Voodoo of any kind
            She had potions and lotions
            Herbs and tanna leaves
            Guaranteed to blow your mind
            Early one morning, into murky swamp dew
            Vanished Marie with hate in her eyes
            Though she'll never return
            All the Cajuns knew
            A witch queen never dies
